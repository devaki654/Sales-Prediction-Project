## Project Overview

The Sales Prediction project uses machine learning to predict future sales by analyzing historical sales data. It explores multiple machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to build accurate predictive models. The project is aimed at helping businesses optimize stock levels, plan promotions, and make data-driven decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and scaling for better model accuracy.
- **Model Selection:** Uses multiple machine learning algorithms to predict sales, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
- **Forecasting Future Sales:** Predicts future sales based on historical trends and external factors like promotions, holidays, and seasonality.
- **Visualization:** Plots graphs and charts to visualize sales trends, predictions, and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis and building machine learning models.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **XGBoost:** For enhanced predictive performance using gradient boosting techniques.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For creating visualizations of data and model results.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and model development (optional).

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction-ml.git
   cd sales-prediction-ml
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development):**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter interface where you can interact with the project code.

## Usage

- **Data Loading:** Load the historical sales data (usually in CSV format) into the project using Pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest on the prepared data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² score to select the best model.
- **Sales Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict future sales and visualize the results.

To run the script that predicts sales, use:

```bash
python sales_prediction.py
```

This will output the predicted sales for the specified period and display evaluation metrics.

## Model Building Process

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the historical sales data.
   - Handle missing values using imputation or deletion.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).
   - Scale numerical features to ensure the model performs well.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - **Linear Regression:** A simple model to predict sales based on historical data.
   - **Random Forest:** An ensemble method to handle complex relationships between features.
   - **XGBoost (optional):** A more advanced model using gradient boosting to improve accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² to select the best model.
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted sales to assess model performance.

4. **Sales Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict future sales for upcoming months or years.
   - Visualize the predicted sales using line charts and bar plots.
